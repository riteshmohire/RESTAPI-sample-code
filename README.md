You need to connect to the random user API following the documentation available at the following link.

 

https://randomuser.me/documentation

 

You need to fetch 3500 random users with nationality as 'US' and perform the following analysis.

 

·         Give a percentage distribution of Male and Female in your list of users

·         Give the count of user based on age in the following category

o    0-15 (Group A)

o    15-30 (Group B) 

o    30-60 (Group C)

o    above 60 (Group D)

·         Find top 5 postal codes with the maximum number of user. Provide the postal code along with the number of users

Build a REST API for your node application with the following URL and response format.

 

GET http://localhost:<port>/nodeapi/user-stats?count=3500

 

Response:

 

 

Text JSON format:

{

  "user-count": 3500,

  "status": "success",

  "sexDistribution": {

    "male": 65,

    "female": 35

  },

  "ageDistribution": {

    "A": 800,

    "B": 1000,

    "C": 1500,

    "D": 200

  },

  "topLocation": {

    "61515": 12,

    "62417": 33,

    "64317": 45,

    "66617": 5,

    "69217": 50

  }

}

 

Deliver a runnable code for this problem. We will run the code and test it with a rest client. You need to log the data requested from the random User API to a simple text file.
